# This small test makes sure that updatecli is working properly on a repo.
# To test this:
#   have "UPDATECLI_GITHUB_ACTOR" env set to your github username
#   have "UPDATECLI_GITHUB_TOKEN" env set to your github token
#   have the latest verison of updatecli installed
#   'updatecli diff -v updatecli/values.yaml -c updatecli/updatecli.d/updatecli.yml'
# In the future, more useful files should be added to this directory.
